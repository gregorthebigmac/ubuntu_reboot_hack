# Description: This will read a file at

# which will describe the nature of the last reboot in one of the following messages:
#
# ACPI-SHUTDOWN
# SOFT-REBOOT
#
# This script will have 3 different behaviors based on what it finds:
#
# ACPI-SHUTDOWN
#	Overwrite $state_file_dir/$state_filename with the following:
#		SOFT-REBOOT
#	Reboot the machine as soon as boot process completes.
#
# SOFT-REBOOT
#	Nothing. Continue the boot process normally, and exit.
#
# [FILE NOT FOUND]
#	Overwrite $state/file_dir/$state_filename with the following:
#		SOFT-REBOOT
#	Reboot the machine as soon as boot process completes.
